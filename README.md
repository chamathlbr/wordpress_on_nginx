This project aims to implement a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant web application
infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The architecture incorporates Nginx as a load balancer,
reverse proxy multiple application servers for distributed processing, HAProxy for database load balancing,
and a MySQL master-master replication setup to ensure data redundancy and high availability.
